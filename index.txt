index is used for faster retravel of data but it will slow down the DML operations

index will be order the column with respective rowid to mapped then it will saved in the table space

giving the pk for opetimization

we can create multiple none cluster index




Cluster Index

cluster index entire table will be order in the main table 

but we can create only one cluster index coz it will modify the main table entirely based on the given index column 

types 

	unique
	non unique
		binary tree (default index)
		bit map
		function based 
		composite


create unique index index_name on table_name(column_name);  -- unique


create index_name on table_name(column_name);  binary tree



when we have more number of duplicates we go for bit map index (ex gender)
create bit map index index_name on table (column) -- bit map


when we go with any function based filters we go with function based index
create index_name on employees(upper(name))


composite index

more than one column more than filters we go with composite 

create index_name on employees(name,salary); 
it will order the name and when duplicate comes it also order the name with salary order
